/*
*   Write an abstract class Animal that contains 2 instance variables: `name` and `age`.
    -   Provide getters and setters for these variables. Add an abstract method `getAgeInHumanYears()`
    that returns int.
    -   Define 2 args constructor that initializes instance variables.

*   Write a class Dog that extends the Animal class. Define 2 instance variables for this class:
`breed` (String) and `humanYears` (int).
    -   Add a constructor that accepts three String parameters.
The value of the first is used to initialize the value of `name`,
the value of the second is used to initialize `age` and the value of the third is used to initialize `breed`.

>Use super() to call parent constructor.

- Override toString() method, so it will display Dog info as in the example below:

    Name: name
    Breed: breed
    Age in calendar years: years
    Age in human years: humanYears
>Hint: Use \n to print a text from a new line.

- Also, implement getAgeInHumanYears method, so It will convert dogs age into humans age as follows:

    if the dog's age is less or equals to 2, multiple age by 11;
    otherwise, human years is equals to: 22 + ((age-2) * 5);

- Override the `equals()` method for the `Dog` class that returns true
if the dog’s name, age, and breed match the same variables for the other object that is being compared.
